Interested In Becoming a Member?

Thank you for your interest in Freemasonry. The only requirements for membership
is a professed belief in a single Supreme Being and the reccommendation of a
member. You should know, howeverer, there are some financial and time
commitments.

Freemasonry is the oldest fraternal organization in the world, with lodges in
almost every country in the free world. It is open to men of adult (18 in MA)
age of any color, any religion, nationality or social standing. The goal of
Freemasonry is to enhance and strengthen the character of the individual man by
providing opportunities for fellowship, charity, education, and leadership based
on the three ancient Masonic tenents, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.

If you are interested in meeting with us for additional information you could
contact the Master, the Secretary or our lodge ambassador(follow the "About Us"
link for phone numbers.) This will enable us to contact you and setup a meeting
at mutual convenience so that you can see the lodge and have any further
questions answered. Your spouse or guest would be most welcome as well.
