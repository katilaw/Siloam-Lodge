<strong>Regular Meetings</strong>

Siloam Lodge regularly meets on the second Monday of each month at 7:00 PM, except in July and August when we do not meet.

Meetings are usually preceeded by a dinner at 6:00 in the banquet hall.  A reservation is not required unless you plan to attend with a group, in which case a call to the Sr. Warden is requested.

Siloam, the celebrated pool at Jerusalem, where men came to refresh themselves and gain the knowledge of the finer and more meaningful things in life, that makes him more valuable to himself and his fellow man.
