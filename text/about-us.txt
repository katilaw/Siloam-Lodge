  <strong>About Siloam Lodge</strong>
  <br>
  Siloam Lodge has been a part of the Westborough community for 150 years!  While we are not a strictly charitable organization we do practice charity.  As such we have over the years supported many community events, both financially and particapatory.  We have contributed to the Boy Scout Council and the Fine Arts Parents Council of the Westborough School System.  We have sponsored a Little League team.  We were one of the first Lodges in the country to particapate in the Masonic Angel Fund program to help students in Westborough, Northborough and Upton.  We have participated in many parades in the area.  We have sponsored Chip events in area towns.
